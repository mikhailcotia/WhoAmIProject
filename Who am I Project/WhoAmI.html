                <p>
                  <b>Fencing</b> is a sport in which two competitors fight using <em>'rapier-style'</em> swords, called the foil, the épée, and the sabre;<br>
                  winning points are made through the contact with an opponent. Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics.<br>
                  Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century,<br>
                  with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing, and the French school <br>
                  later refining the Italian system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each uses a different kind of weapon<br>
                  and has different rules, this way the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, épée, and sabre.<br>
                  Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.<br>
                  I used to play for my school's varsity fencing team. I know how to play with all three swords but choose to use the Foil sword.<br>

                <strong>Football</strong> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal.<br>
                Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context<br>
                in which the word appears. Sports commonly called '<i>football</i>' in certain places include: association football<br>
                (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;<br>
                rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.<br>
                I like to play Football recreationally. My position in Football is 'Midfielder' or 'Defender'.<br>
